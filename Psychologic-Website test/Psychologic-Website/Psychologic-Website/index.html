                        <h3>Stress Management Therapy</h3><br>
                        <p>Stress is a natural part of life. It comes in many forms: emotional, mental, and/or physical. The occasional stressors are harmless to our health. In fact, stressors can be utilized to push us to work towards important goals, or motivate us <br>out of a bad situation. Moderate levels of stress allow the body and mind to respond at a faster speed. However, when the stressor becomes chronic, it can cause significant mental strain and long-term health problems.</p><br class="js--therapy3"><br><br><br><br>
                        <h3>Behaviour Therapy</h3><br>
                        <p>There are several types of behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most beneficial ways to deal with stress. In CBT, people are taught to recognize and change negative thought patterns and apply different tools to help them improve their negative-self talk to be more positive. For relieving stress, this means people can learn to be less hard on themselves and to recognize that it’s ok to reduce some of their burdens </p><br class="js--therapy5"><br><br><br><br><br>

A thought disorder disrupts a person’s thought process. It is a disturbance in the organization and expression of thought, which causes incoherent or illogical speech and behavior. Thought disorders are found in autism and other serious illnesses</p><br class="js--therapy7"><br><br><br><br><br>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p><br><br><p id="blog-1-para-2">
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. </p>
